# üìñ About the Project <a name="about-project"></a>

This project demonstrates an **Library Management Database** implemented using Supabase (PostgreSQL).
It integrates Row Level Security (RLS), Admin & User roles, and custom SQL policies to control data access and enforce least privilege principles.

The System includes:  
- ‚úÖ Tables for students, books, and borrow_records
- ‚úÖ UUID-based authentication via Supabase Auth
- ‚úÖ Role-based access policies (Admin vs Student)
- ‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) on all tables
- ‚úÖ SQL functions for admin-only operations

---

## üõ† Built With <a name="built-with"></a>

- **Supabase** ‚Äì PostgreSQL + Auth + Policy Management  
- **PostgreSQL** ‚Äì Structured database engine and tables  
- **RLS Policies** - Fine-grained access control
- **SQL Functions** ‚Äì Role-based admin actions

---

## üöÄ Live Demo <a name="live-demo"></a>

- [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/pwsbzyjjqwxtqzzpaghy)  

---

## üíª Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites
- Supabase account
- Basic SQL and PostgreSQL knowledge
-Git installed
- GitHub account for project submission  

### Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Penninah116/library-management-db
cd library-management-db

```

```bash
Usage

Open Supabase SQL editor

Run schema.sql to create tables & sample data

Apply UUID + RLS setup:
Enable Row Level Security
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE students ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE books ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE borrow_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;



Apply user vs admin policies.
```

## üíæ Sample SQL Queries & Policies <a name="sample-sql-queries"></a>

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ User Policies
```sql
-- Students can view only their own borrow records
CREATE POLICY "Students can view their own borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR SELECT
USING (
  student_id = current_setting('request.student_id')::INT
);
```sql
 -- Students can insert their own borrow records
CREATE POLICY "Students can insert their own borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  student_id = current_setting('request.student_id')::INT
);

```

```sql
--Restrict Students to Only View Books They've Borrowed
CREATE POLICY "Students can view borrowed books only"
ON books
FOR SELECT
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM borrow_records
    WHERE borrow_records.book_id = books.id
    AND borrow_records.student_id = current_setting('request.student_id')::INT
  )
);

```
---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Policies
```sql
--  Admins can manage all borrow records

CREATE POLICY "Admins have full access to borrow records"
ON borrow_records
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM students WHERE students.id = borrow_records.student_id AND students.major = 'Admin'
  )
);

```sql
-- Admins can manage all books
CREATE POLICY "Admins have full access to books"
ON books
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM students WHERE auth_user_id = auth.uid() AND major = 'Admin'
  )
);

```

```sql
--Admins can manage all student records
CREATE POLICY "Admins can manage all students"
ON students
FOR ALL
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM users WHERE users.user_uuid = auth.uid() AND users.role = 'admin'
  )
);

```

---
 ### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Example CRUD Queries with their output.
 ```sql
--List all books currently borrowed (not yet returned)
SELECT b.title, s.name AS borrower, br.borrow_date
FROM borrow_records br
JOIN books b ON br.book_id = b.id
JOIN students s ON br.student_id = s.id
WHERE br.return_date IS NULL;


--List all books borrowed by a specific student (e.g., 'Alice Kim')
SELECT b.title, br.borrow_date, br.return_date
FROM borrow_records br
JOIN books b ON br.book_id = b.id
JOIN students s ON br.student_id = s.id
WHERE s.name = 'Alice Kim';


--View All Borrow Records with Student and Book Details
  SELECT 
  br.id AS borrow_id,
  s.name AS student_name,
  s.email,
  b.title AS book_title,
  b.author,
  br.borrow_date,
  br.return_date
FROM borrow_records br
JOIN students s ON br.student_id = s.id
JOIN books b ON br.book_id = b.id
ORDER BY br.borrow_date DESC;

```

## ‚ùì FAQ <a name="faq"></a>

**Q: How do I test RLS policies?**  
A: Sign in as User vs Admin and try CRUD operations. Policies will restrict or allow access accordingly.  

**Q: Can I extend this to a front-end?**  
A: Yes, connect Supabase Auth with **Angular**, **Java**, or any front-end framework.
